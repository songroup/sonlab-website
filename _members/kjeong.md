**Kyeong-jun Jeong** was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Chemistry at SNU until the summer in 2025. He received his B.S. in chemistry from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in 2014 and completed his Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2020. His research interests focus on understanding molecular design principles of soft material self-assembly and nanoscopic phase behavior by molecular dynamics simulations with atomistic models. He is now a professor of chemistry at Kyonggi University. **We sincerely appreciate his contribution as a mentor in our lab, and wish him the best in the new chapter of his career.**
